# Gethem

GeThem is a hiring platform where anyone can directly apply to jobs or refer other candidates and get rewarded if the person they invited is hired. Our decentralized dapp ensures fair reward distribution to referrals, an on-chain reputation score for referrers and helps candidates build and validate their on-chain resumes for the longer run.

Problems addressed:
- Referrers who are community owners find it difficult to submit referrals for other organisations.
- Recruiters reward results, but not engagement.
